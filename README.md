# svg-geometry-experiments
Placing shapes relative to the center of a SVG document

SVG and JavaScript experiments for visualizing angle, position, and modular geometric constructions.

## Quick Start

Open `index.html` in your browser. All code is modular and lives in `src/` and `style/`.

## Structure

- `index.html` – Loads the visualization and scripts
- `src/` – JavaScript modules for shapes, math, and rendering
- `style/` – CSS styles
- `docs/` – Design conversations, sketches, and plans

## Development

1. Clone the repo
2. Open `index.html` directly in your browser (no build step needed)
3. Edit or add modules in `src/` as needed

## Project Goals

- Explore SVG and HTML for geometric and animated visualizations
- Modularize code for shape drawing, labeling, and animation
- Document design decisions and learning for future reference
